Welcome to Yearn Gold.

Yearn Gold is a new token made with you, the holder, in mind. With inspiration taken
from the renowned Yearn Finance (YFI) token, Yearn Gold aims to provide a unique
experience throughout its development stages as we strive to provide an entire
ecosystem to the people of the DeFi space.
The launch of the Yearn Gold Token (YAU) will be the birth of the ecosystem, with
staking as a key feature which will be rewarding those who choose to stake their coins
through a secondary coin, the Yearn Gold Staking Token (YAUS). Our thesis for this
plan is that rewarding hodlers through a second token prevents negative price action on
the main token while still giving hodlers an incentive to stake.
